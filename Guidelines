1. Download CentOS and QRadar iso files.
  
    http://isoredirect.centos.org/centos/7/isos/x86_64/CentOS-7-x86_64-Minimal-1804.iso(Minimal)
    
    https://developer.ibm.com/qradar/ce/

2. Install the downloaded CentOS iso in Workstation or VBox.

    https://www.virtualbox.org/  or  https://www.vmware.com/in/products/workstation-pro/workstation-pro-evaluation.html
    

3. Since this is a very basic setup and I use this for testing purpose I will go with the below configuration. You should assign the resources based upon your need,

        Interface : Single(NAT)
        RAM       : 4GB
        Storage   : 80GB
        Core      : 2
4. Once you have logged in the VM, kindly check if you are able to ping any websites to ensure the internet connectivity to VM. If we get packets back then its perfectly fine and you can move with step 5. Below are the few issues which I face during this step,

      a. Interface not showing up,
      b. No IP assigned to my interface
      
      Since this is a terminal based installation you cannot find any GUI buttons to enable and disable network interfaces. Find the below steps to overcome the issue mentioned above. Enter the below command in your terminal and you will see a terminal UI which contains control units for playing with the interfaces.
      
      a. nmtui

      b. Edit Connection >> ens33(Check your active interface) >> Connect Automatically(Make sure this check box is checked). 
  
      I have attached an image for your reference "Interface_Image.PNG". once the changes has been done restart the network services,
  
      $ systemctl restart network
